# Mapping California's EV Charging Deserts with Power BI 🚗🔋📍

With transportation being the largest contributor to US greenhouse gas emissions, the Biden administration recently unveiled a $5 billion plan to build out a national electric vehicle charging network. This investment aims to facilitate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles. 🌱💚

California is ahead of the curve, boasting over 73,000 public charging ports - the most in the country. 🏆 However, simply having a large quantity of chargers does not guarantee equitable and convenient access for all drivers. 🚫 I performed an exploratory data analysis on California's EV charging locations using Power BI to identify gaps in the current network. 📊📈

Using Power BI's filled maps, I visualized the geographic distribution of charging ports across California's counties. 🗺️ This allowed me to pinpoint the "charging deserts". 🏜️ Key insights:

Rural northern counties have port densities well below the recommended minimums. 🚨 For example, Inyo county has just 34 ports for 18,000 square miles. 😱
Charging access is heavily concentrated around major metros like Los Angeles and the Bay Area. 🏙️ Urban drivers have abundant options, while rural drivers are underserved. ❌🛣️
Tesla stations comprise over 40% of charging ports, but are walled gardens exclusive to Tesla vehicles. 🔒 Non-Tesla owners have fewer options. 🚫
While California has made impressive progress, this analysis shows there is still work to be done in upgrading infrastructure equitably statewide. ↗️ As California moves forward, focus areas should include: ✅

Increasing port densities in rural counties to provide convenient charging access to all drivers. 🗺️⛽
Encouraging additional investment from other networks besides Tesla to serve all EV brands. 🤝💰
Exploring creative options like battery swapping and mobile charging in remote areas. 💡🔋🚙
The federal investment in EV infrastructure presents an opportunity to address these gaps, not just in California but nationally.
